       "['CHAPTER I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA. To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Edler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect of all.\\n',\n",
       " 'I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\" \"\\'Seven,\\' I answered. Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness. Then how do you know?\" \"\\'I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant-girl?\\' \"\\'My dear Holmes,\\' said I, \"\\'this is too much. You would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess. But as I have changed my clothes, I can\\'t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible. My wife has given her notice, but there again I cannot tell you.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.\" Peculiar! That is the very word,\" said Holmes. It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.\" I did so, and saw a large E with a small G, a capital P, and a large capital G with a small T woven into the texture of the paper. \"\\'What do you make of that?\\' asked Holmes. \"\\'The name of the maker, no doubt. Or his monogram, rather.\\' \"\\'Not at all. The G with a small T stands for Gesellschaft, which is German for company. It is a customary contraction like our CO for company. P, of course, stands for Papier. Now for the EG. Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.\\' He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelf.\\n',\n",
       " 'You may address me as the Count von Kram, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.\" I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. \"\\'It is both or none,\\' said he. \"\\'You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.\\' The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \"\\'Then I must begin,\\' said he, \"\\'by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years. At the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.\\'\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Was there a secret marriage? None. No legal papers or certificates? None. Then I failed to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity? There is the writing. A poo-poo forgery. My private note-paper. Stolen. My own seal. Imitated. My photograph. Bought. We were both in the photograph. Oh dear, that is very bad. Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion. I was mad. Insane. You have compromised yourself seriously. I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\\n',\n",
       " \"shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down before the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head. It was close.\\n\",\n",
       " 'his mistress. If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentlemen\\'s chambers in the temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.\" I am following you closely,\" I answered. I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a handsome cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached, evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past me\\n',\n",
       " 'very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the temple, and she to her own house. \"\\'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,\\' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements. \"\\'Which are?\\' \"\\'Some cold beef and a glass of beer,\\' he answered, ringing the bell. \"\\'I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, doctor, I shall want your cooperation. I shall be delighted. \"\\'You don\\'t mind breaking the law?\\' \"\\'Not in the least.\\' \"\\'Nor running a chance of arrest?\\' \"\\'Not in a good cause.\\' \"\\'Oh, the cause is excellent. Then I am your man.\\' I was sure that I could do it.\\n',\n",
       " 'lunging up and down with cigars in their mouths. \"\\'You see,\\' remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, \"\\'this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, where are we to find the photograph?\\' \"\\'Where, indeed?\\' \"\\'It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet-size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman\\'s dress. She knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.\\' \"\\'Where, then?\\' \"\\'Her banker or her lawyer. Where could we see it?\\'\\n',\n",
       " 'hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her, we are but preventing her from injuring another. Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand, and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of, Fire! The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well-dressed and ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids—joined in a general shriek of, Fire! Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within, assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd, I made my way to the corner of the room.\\n',\n",
       " 'There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by. I\\'ve heard that voice before, said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been! PART III I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning, when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room. \"\\'You have really got it?\\' he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face. \"\\'Not yet.\\' \"\\'But you have hopes?\\' \"\\'I have hopes.\\' \"\\'Then come! I am all impatience to be gone.\\' \"\\'We must have a cab.\\' \"\\'No, my brougham is waiting.\\' \"\\'Then that will simplify matters.\\' We descended and started off once more for Bryony Lodge.\\n',\n",
       " 'I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess, and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, very truly yours, Irene Norton, N. A. Adler. What a woman! Oh, what a woman! cried the King of Bohemia when we had all three read this epistle. Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level? From what I have seen of the lady, she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty,\" said Holmes coldly. I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty\\'s business to a more successful conclusion. On the contrary, my dear sir, cried the King. Nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire. I am glad to hear your Majesty say so. I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me at what way I can reward you. This ring—he slipped an emerald snake-ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand. Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly, said Holmes. You have but to name it. This photograph— The King stared in amazement. Irene\\'s photograph! he cried. Certainly, if you wish it. I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good morning. He bowed, and turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers. And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman\\'s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of woman, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of The Woman.\\n']"

Well, yes, the truth is that it is a great pleasure and the truth is that I have learned a lot in that program with Fernando and yes, it has been a pleasure. So, well, here we are for whatever it takes. Well, we will continue, we are very excited to enter for real. The truth is that even things to debate, but hey, we'll talk about it. And nothing, we say goodbye to Javier Amendi, at tam tam vera Amendi on Twitter. Mr. Javier, the traitor that you make. I urinated this because I had my head like this, like a bomb with the accent. If you want to talk, take it. Now I'm going to drop you a microphone and I'm going to let you talk. Perfectly, my little revenge. Well, nothing, we say goodbye, you already know that we are on all social networks, but our website is histocas.com and there you can find all the information you need from us. Ala, say goodbye to everyone. Come on. See you later. Agudos semper fidelis.\\n\"]"
