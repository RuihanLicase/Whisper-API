      "CHAPTER I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA. To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Edler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen. But as a lover, he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a guibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer, excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Edler, of dubious and questionable memory. I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the Holmes-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, was sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings, of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and, finally, of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the Daily Press, I knew little of my former friend and companion. One night, it was on the 20th of March, 1888, I was returning from a journey to a patient, for I had now returned to civil practice, when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell, and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own. His manner was not effusive—it seldom was—but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he weaved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasegene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion. \"'Wedlock suits you,' he remarked. \"'I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.' \"'Seven,' I answered. \"'Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness. Even how do you know?' \"'I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant-girl?' \"'My dear Holmes,' said I, \"'this is too much. You would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there again I fail to see how you work it out.'\" He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together. \"'It is simplicity itself,' said he. \"'My eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you have been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavy. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my room smelling a biotaform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top hat, to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull indeed if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.'\" I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. \"'When I hear you give your reasons,' I remarked, \"'the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.'\" \"'Quite so,' he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. \"'You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.'\" \"'Frequently?' \"'How often?' \"'Well, some hundreds of times.' \"'Then how many are there?' \"'How many? I don't know.' \"'Quite so. You have not observed, and yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\" He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. \"'It came by the last post,' said he. \"'Read it aloud.' The note was undated, and without either signature or address. \"'There will call upon you to-night at a quarter to eight o'clock,' it said. \"'A gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.' \"'This is indeed a mystery,' I remarked. \"'What do you imagine that it means?' \"'I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself—what do you deduce from it?' I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written. \"'The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,' I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. Such paper could not be found anywhere.\n",

      "This is Istokar, not Sparta but almost. It is not Bactria, it is not Ait Kanun, it is not Taxila and it is not Samarkand either. But we are going to talk about all places because we are going to talk about the Greek states of Central Asia. What do you mean Greek states? Yes, friends, yes, friends. There was a time when there were Greek states out there. As little as you know, Alejandro Seyoung Arbeo is out there. And well, there were Greek states out there. So, well, we are going to deal with this strange topic right now with Fernando Pastor González. How are you, Fernando? How are you? How are you? Delighted. Well, nothing, we are delighted. You debut with us, Fernando. Anyone would say that it will be great because you have already done two programs in Central Asia. But no, in this case you are going to be the one who takes the singer's voice and I told Fran, hey, they are going to talk about this, are you interested in being there? And he says yes, yes, because I am interested in this topic and I would have liked to go deeper. And well, since you were here, instead of a listener, a listener in situ, live. Fernando is a history graduate from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and also a librarian at the CESIC Human and Social Sciences Center. A person who is also present here told me, Javiera Mendy, hey, I'm not saying anything, but I don't usually give the ball. This is a program that we have that is phenomenal. And I ask him, I say, of course, ask him. And here we are. I think they are the best programs, the ones that come up like this and boom. And they are such rare topics that they are beautiful, how rare they are. And since no one deals with them, before, off the mic, you were saying, hey, there is very little in Spanish, there is very little in Spanish to listen to, to see. Well, here we are to deal with that. So, Fernando, this is your home. Thank you very much. With total tranquility, as if we were in a bar bar. Not so much, but feel like family. And before I mentioned Fran Olmos, well, before continuing with Fran Olmos, you have Twitter, Fernando, at educo free. Yes, it is a small account that I have, I put it, above all they are old buildings, until the industrial revolution. In the end, I never got to the 18th century, but they are always buildings or ruins that have something, something that interests me, especially from a historical point of view, you know? Not so much from an artistic point of view, that there are some that are beautiful anyway. But well, I always liked to share, share and well, I started that account as a hobby, it has been almost five years and the truth is that I have managed to gather a good community, which helps me to want to continue posting every day. Contributing things, not like mine. So, well, we move on to Fran Olmos, Fran Olmos, which is on Twitter at Fran bar bar Olmos, that is, two bars, and who has been with us in two programs. He has been in the Istokas 253 Central Asia of the Muslim Conquest of the Turkic Empires and in the 270 Central Asia of the Mongol Conquest of Tamerlan. And it gives me that we are going to continue there because, well, there is a lot of chicha. In fact, that was going to be an introductory program, do you remember, Fran? Look what happened in the end, right? And the truth is that the subject, the subject when you proposed it to me, is one that always came to my mind, about reading more, learning more, but you have to make some Greeks out there lost, out of the hand of Zeus, but hey, the perfect moment to learn more about the subject. And here we are for that, to discover new things. And well, we have Javier Amendi, who is really the mastermind of all this, the one who has messed up Fernando. In fact, Fernando was saying, what are you doing? I don't know what, I don't know how many. We know, Fernando. Javier Amendi, at Tam Tam, see Amendi on Twitter, and member of the group of studies of military history. And as you know, the magazine of Espertaferro, contemporary history. Well, it has been that he has messed us up, so let's see, because I don't want to extend myself in the interruption, because then they will throw us the tantrum. I will practice Greek Ladino, if I see that the thing goes wrong, I will disappear. And now, hey, let Fernando get it. Well, the important thing is that we don't do the one of Geno Fonte, or anything like that. Let's pass it on with tranquility. Well, the one who speaks to you, Gojix, and you know that all of us are on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Telegram, YouTube, on all social networks, there are those who can see. I'm getting more and more lazy, I got it with a lot of energy, but uff, I'm getting old. Our website is Istokas.com and our email is info.istokas.com On the website you can leave us audio if you want, and you have the page of Dukebelly.com to make you with the Istokas shirts, or of Greeks who get lost there, or whatever. Well, we haven't reached Alejandro's yet, but he will be there. I'm sure Alejandro has some shirt. And now the heat is coming, so it depends on what temperature you are in. Well, and surely, as is tradition, we are going to send greetings. I'm going to send a... I'm going to go ahead, Fernando, it's tradition that the guest greets, right? But I'm going to send a greeting to a listener named Javier Castillo. I went to buy some books and well, I bought them precisely with... I had an Istokas bill to buy those books. Then the listener told me, hey, my boyfriend is listening. Well, what a coincidence, I say, what's his name? Javier Castillo. Well, Javier Castillo, we send you greetings. There it is, thanks to your girl, to whom we also greet. And Fernando, who do you want to send a greeting to on a program like this? Well, look, thinking about it a little bit, I would like to say hello, on the one hand, to my father. My father is a person who began to investigate his issues completely for free, with rigour, but let's say that only. He had studied law, he had studied... he had a career that had nothing to do with research. And out of pure... I don't know how to say it, out of pure curiosity, he started with a topic, a topic that is his, he is interested in it, he is also interested in four more, but he has not given up, nor has he left it after even 30 years. That on the one hand, and on the other hand, well, I have several friends, people, for example, the people of the Dragon Club, people who can be a little peculiar, a little peculiar, but who will always give you a pretty interesting talk. You know, in the end, this is moved a little by affinities, this is moved a little by, well, by feedback. You know, for example, I already told you that I did the history course, but in the end I was moving through other, through other losers and finding people in the same league with whom to talk about these things, the truth is that it is much appreciated, it is much appreciated. And well, these people...\n",
